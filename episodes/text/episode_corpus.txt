conditional independence in statistics two random variables might depend on one another for example interest rates and new home purchases we call this conditional dependence an important related concept exists called conditional independence this phrase describes situations in which two variables are independent of one another given some other variable for example the probability that vendor will pay their bill on time could depend on many factors such as the company market cap thus statistical analysis would reveal many relationships between observable details about the company and their propensity for paying on time however if you know that the company has filed for bankruptcy then we might assume their chances of paying on time have dropped to near and the result is now independent of all other factors in light of this new information we discuss few real world analogies to this idea in the context of some chance meetings on our recent trip to new york city
estimating sheep pain with facial recognition animals can tell us when they re experiencing pain so we have to rely on other cues to help treat their discomfort but it is often difficult to tell how much an animal is suffering the sheep for instance is the most inscrutable of animals however scientists have figured out way to understand sheep facial expressions using artificial intelligence on this week episode dr marwa mahmoud from the university of cambridge joins us to discuss her recent study estimating sheep pain level using facial action unit detection marwa and her colleague at cambridge computer laboratory developed an automated system using machine learning algorithms to detect and assess when sheep is in pain we discuss some details of her work how she became interested in studying sheep facial expression to measure pain and her future goals for this project if you re able to be in minneapolis mn on august rd or th consider attending farcon get your tickets today via https farcon eventbrite com

multi agent diverse generative adversarial networks despite the success of gans in imaging one of its major drawbacks is the problem of mode collapse where the generator learns to produce samples with extremely low variety to address this issue today guests arnab ghosh and viveka kulharia proposed two different extensions the first involves tweaking the generator objective function with diversity enforcing term that would assess similarities between the different samples generated by different generators the second comprises modifying the discriminator objective function pushing generations corresponding to different generators towards different identifiable modes
generative adversarial networks gans are an unsupervised learning method involving two neural networks iteratively competing the discriminator is typical learning system it attempts to develop the ability to recognize members of certain class such as all photos which have birds in them the generator attempts to create false examples which the discriminator incorrectly classifies in successive training rounds the networks examine each and play mini max game of trying to harm the performance of the other in addition to being useful way of training networks in the absence of large body of labeled data there are additional benefits the discriminator may end up learning more about edge cases than it otherwise would be given typical examples also the generator false images can be novel and interesting on their own the concept was first introduced in the paper generative adversarial networks

auto correlative functions and correlograms when working with time series data there are number of important diagnostics one should consider to help understand more about the data the auto correlative function plotted as correlogram helps explain how given observations relates to recent preceding observations very random process like lottery numbers would show very low values while temperature our topic in this episode does correlate highly with recent days below is time series of the weather in chapel hill nc every morning over few years you can clearly see an annual cyclic pattern which should be no surprise to anyone yet you can also see fair amount of variance from day to day even if you de trend the annual cycle we can see that this would not be enough for yesterday temperature to perfectly predict today weather below is correlogram of the acf auto correlative function for very low values of lag comparing the most recent temperature measurement to the values of previous days we can see quick drop off this tells us that weather correlates very highly but decliningly so with recent days interestingly we also see it negatively correlate with days far away this is because of the opposite seasons we experience the annual cycle of the planet is visible as we see weaker correlations with previous years this highlights one limit to the acf if compares the current weather to all previous days and reports those correlations independently if we know today and yesterday weather the weather from two days ago might not add as much information for that reason we also want to review the pacf partial auto correlative function which subtracts the correlation of previous days for each lag so that we get an estimate of what each of those days actually contributes to the most recent observation in the plots below of the same data we see all the seasonal and annual correlations disappear we expect this because most of the information about how the weather depends on the past is already contained in the most recent few days the boundaries shown in the above plots represent measure of statistical significant any points outside this rang are considered statistically significant those below it are not as many listeners know kyle and linh da are looking to buy house in fact they ve made an offer on house in the zipcode thanks to the trulia api we can get time series of the average median listing price of homes in that zipcode and see if it gives us any insight into the viability of this investment future the plot below shows the time series of the median listing price note that not the same as the sale price on daily basis over the past few years let first take look at it acf below for price we see no surprise that recent listing prices are pretty good predictors of current listing prices unless some catastrophe or major event like discovery of oil or large gold vein changed things overnight home prices should have relatively stable short term prices and therefore be very auto correlative as we did previously we now want to look at the pacf below which shows us that the two most recent days have the most useful information although not surprising was wondering if we might find some interesting effects related to houses being listed on weekdays vs weekends or at specific times of the month however it seems that when dealing with such large amounts of money people have bit more patience perhaps selling car or smaller item might show some periodic lags but the home prices do not

bias variance tradeoff discussion of the expected number of cars at stoplight frames today discussion of the bias variance tradeoff the central ideal of this concept relates to model complexity very simple model will likely generalize well from training to testing data but will have very high variance since it simplicity can prevent it from capturing the relationship between the covariates and the output as model grows more and more complex it may capture more of the underlying data but the risk that it overfits the training data and therefore does not generalize is biased increases the tradeoff between minimizing variance and minimizing bias is an ongoing challenge for data scientists and an important discussion for skeptics around how much we should trust models
