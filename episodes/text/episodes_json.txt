In this episode, we explore how such a network would be able to represent three common logical operators: OR, AND, and XOR. The XOR operation is the interesting case. Below are the truth tables that describe each of these functions. AND Truth Table    Input 1 Input 2 Output     0 0 0   0 1 0   1 0 0   1 1 1    OR Truth Table    Input 1 Input 2 Output     0 0 0   0 1 1   1 0 1   1 1 1    XOR Truth Table    Input 1 Input 2 Output     0 0 0   0 1 1   1 0 1   1 1 0    The AND and OR functions should seem very intuitive. Exclusive or (XOR) if true if and only if exactly single input is 1. Could a neural network learn these mathematical functions? Let's consider the perceptron described below. First we see the visual representation, then the Activation function , followed by the formula for calculating the output.              Can this perceptron learn the AND function? Sure. Let  and  What about OR? Yup. Let  and  An infinite number of possible solutions exist, I just picked values that hopefully seem intuitive. This is also a good example of why the bias term is important. Without it, the AND function could not be represented. How about XOR? No. It is not possible to represent XOR with a single layer. It requires two layers. The image below shows how it could be done with two laters.      In the above example, the weights computed for the middle hidden node capture the essence of why this works. This node activates when recieving two positive inputs, thus contributing a heavy penalty to be summed by the output node. If a single input is 1, this node will not activate. Universal approximation theorem tells us that any continuous function can be tightly approximated using a neural network with only a single hidden layer and a finite number of neurons. With this in mind, a feed forward neural network should be adaquet for any applications. However, in practice, other network architectures and the allowance of more hidden layers are empirically motivated. Other types neural networks have less strict structal definitions. The various ways one might relax this constraint generate other classes of neural networks that often have interesting properties. We'll get into some of these in future mini-episodes.

The auto-correlative function, plotted as a correlogram, helps explain how a given observations relates to recent preceding observations. A very random process (like lottery numbers) would show very low values, while temperature (our topic in this episode) does correlate highly with recent days.        Below is a time series of the weather in Chapel Hill, NC every morning over a few years. You can clearly see an annual cyclic pattern, which should be no surprise to anyone. Yet, you can also see a fair amount of variance from day to day. Even if you de-trend the annual cycle, we can see that this would not be enough for yesterday's temperature to perfectly predict today's weather.                       Below is a correlogram of the ACF (auto-correlative function). For very low values of lag (comparing the most recent temperature measurement to the values of previous days), we can see a quick drop-off. This tells us that weather correlates very highly, but decliningly so, with recent days. Interestingly, we also see it negatively correlate with days far away. This is because of the \"opposite\" seasons we experience. The annual cycle of the planet is visible as we see weaker correlations with previous years. This highlights one limit to the ACF. If compares the current weather to all previous days and reports those correlations independently. If we know today and yesterday's weather, the weather from two days ago might not add as much information.                      For that reason, we also want to review the PACF (partial auto-correlative function) which subtracts the correlation of previous days for each lag so that we get an estimate of what each of those days actually contributes to the most recent observation. In the plots below of the same data, we see all the seasonal and annual correlations disappear. We expect this because most of the information about how the weather depends on the past is already contained in the most recent few days.                    The boundaries shown in the above plots represent a measure of statistical significant. Any points outside this rang are considered statistically significant. Those below it are not.     As many listeners know, Kyle and Linh Da are looking to buy a house. In fact, they've made an offer on a house in the zipcode 90008. Thanks to the Trulia API, we can get a time series of the average median listing price of homes in that zipcode and see if it gives us any insight into the viability of this investment's future!      The plot below shows the time series of the median listing price (note, that's not the same as the sale price) on a daily basis over the past few years.                       Let's first take a look at it's ACF below. For price, we see (no surprise) that recent listing prices are pretty good predictors of current listing prices. Unless some catastrophe or major event (like discovery of oil or a large gold vein) changed things overnight, home prices should have relatively stable short term prices, and therefore, be very auto-correlative.                  As we did previously, we now want to look at the PACF (below) which shows us that the two most recent days have the most useful information. Although not surprising, I was wondering if we might find some interesting effects related to houses being listed on weekdays vs. weekends, or at specific times of the month. However, it seems that when dealing with such large amounts of money, people have a bit more patience. Perhaps selling a car or a smaller item might show some periodic lags, but the home prices do not.

She's currently at Metis Data Science, an organization that helps people learn the skills of data science to transition in industry. In this episode, we discuss fMRI technology, Laurie's research studying empathy and psychopathy, as well as the skills and tools used in common between neuroscientists and data scientists.

The central ideal of this concept relates to model complexity. A very simple model will likely generalize well from training to testing data, but will have a very high variance since it's simplicity can prevent it from capturing the relationship between the covariates and the output. As a model grows more and more complex, it may capture more of the underlying data but the risk that it overfits the training data and therefore does not generalize (is biased) increases.

What are the error bounds on the way it was measured? These are just some of the questions one should ask to understand their data.
