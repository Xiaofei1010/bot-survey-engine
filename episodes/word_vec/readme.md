Files in the folder word_vec store all word vectors generated from the dataset of Stack Exchange by word2vec models.
One has to run the file **gensim_model/gensim_models_question_answer python3.ipynb** to generate it. Or download word2vector_model_question_answer_200_6_2.csv from my google driver: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-4FukuZM1Kbm81UkF3RnRjY2c/view?usp=sharing
